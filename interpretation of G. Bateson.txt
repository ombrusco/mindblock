I cannot say that my mother is guilty. After all, I am the same sort of person she is.
Or was my grandmother guilty? 
She had eyes as blue as that book there, and was the same sort of person as my mother and I. 
I can say that she affected me because she made me crazy (by her love). 
But if I say that, I thereby make myself unlovable. 
I would only be condemning myself. Surely you can understand that. 
After all, you are just like she was. 
Look, there are people who really live (not like me and my mother).
Not everybody lives with a wall between him and life. 
But whenever I get a chance to live, the quarreling starts. 
My parents blame me for it, just as everybody always blames the other side. 
And if they succeed in preventing me from living, they will always turn on me and blame me for everything
Like you, they will try to change what sort of man I am. 
If I should turn and try to live and get beaten down, my trying to live would cause a war.
